## Post-Launch Phases

- **Phase ID**: P-Future-TTS
- **Title**: AI-Powered Audio Messages
- **User Story**: "As a user, I want to be able to send my messages as audible voice notes, so that I can communicate in a more expressive way."
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Notes**: Deferred until after initial launch. Requires a custom, self-hosted server running the `eSpeak` text-to-speech engine to be built by the project owner. This will provide a more cost-effective and efficient solution than a general-purpose LLM.
